The job failed because the flake8 command was not found. This means flake8 is not installed in the environment before it's used.

**Solution:**  
Add a step to install flake8 before running it in your workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml).  
For example, update your workflow steps to include:

```yaml
- name: Install flake8
  run: pip install flake8

- name: Run flake8
  run: |
    flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
    flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=79 --statistics
```

Place the "Install flake8" step before any step that uses flake8.

**Summary:**  
Install flake8 using pip before running flake8 commands in your workflow. This will fix the "command not found" error and allow your job to proceed.
